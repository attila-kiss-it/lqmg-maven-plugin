	<h1>LQMG Maven Plugin</h1>

	<h2>Introduction</h2>

	<p>This maven plugin can be used to generate QueryDSL metadata
		classes from Liquibase changeLog files in the way that the changeLog
		files are placed into OSGi bundles.</p>

	<h2>Usage</h2>

	<p>Although it is possible to configure the plugin in the way that
		it is attached to an execution, it is not recommended. As the schema
		does not change every day, we normally use the plugin from the command
		line. E.g.:</p>

	<div class="source">
		<pre>
  mvn org.everit.osgi.dev:lqmg-maven-plugin:generate -Dlqmg.schemaExpression=mySchema</pre>
	</div>
	<p>
		For more information about the configuration possibilities, see the <a
			href="plugin-info.html">plugin-info</a> page.
